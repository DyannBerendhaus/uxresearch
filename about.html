                            <p>I’m Dyann, a naturally curious person, passionate about user experience (UX) research. I love learning what motivates people and helping them achieve whatever it is through solutions they didn’t know they needed. </p>
                            <p>Currently, I’m working as a UX researcher and designer at Easy LMS where I am their first UX employee. I’m acting as a middleman between their clients and the product development team whilst researching their clients’ needs using various design thinking methods.</p>
                            <p>I have an applied sciences Bachelor’s majoring in Communication and Multimedia Design (BSc) with a minor in Data Engineering. Throughout the course of my studies, I have specialised in UX research.</p>
                            <p class="quote">"UX research enables the creation of products and services that are more likely to be successful in the market and more satisfying for users."</p></br>

                            <h2>Learning</h2>
                            <p>It is essential to growing. And you mostly learn by doing and making mistakes. I believe we should never stop learning and adapting our current mental models. This can be intrinsic or external. Challenges that allow me to enable this for both colleagues and users are ones I thrive in.</p>

                            <h2>Privacy</h2>
                            <p>You don’t like being watched either I assume. In my research, I strive to only use anonymized data. When this is not possible, I will make sure to get consent ahead of time with the possibility to opt-out and delete any gathered information at any time.</p>

                            <h2>Ethics</h2>
                            <p>Honesty and fairness are things I highly value. I think it’s essential to think about the consequences and impact of functionalities, features, and products before they are worked on. Moreover, I find it equally important to evaluate current practices.</p>
